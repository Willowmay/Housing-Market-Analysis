# Housing-Market-Analysis

This project is the final project for one of my data analytic courses at Columbia University with my classmate Adam Kirstein!


1. Data Description

The dataset on which we are conducting our analysis focuses on housing information collected from Craigslist.com. 
The dataset was scraped by a research team at the University of Washington in Seattle on October first, 
and includes house listings from as far back as March of 2016. 

The team has been collecting data through Craigslist.com, 
among many other sources during an ongoing exploration into the behavior of rent across Seattle, 
in part to measure the impact of housing ordinances enacted by the Seattle Housing Authority. 

The dataset itself is broken into columns that indicate various aspects of housing, 
such as: Listing title, Listing date, Listing month, Rent price, Square Feet, Latitude and Longitude, Match address, 
number of Bathrooms and Bedrooms. 

The data file consists of 48 columns, and 40,600 rows, (90.56MB). 


2. Questions & Assumptions

With this dataset, we hope to explore the intricacies of rent behavior within the city of Seattle. To do so, we have developed questions that will lead our analytical efforts into this data. Below outline or intentions for analysis: 
1) What housing criteria can we use to best predict rent?
2) Which model will allow us to predict rent with the highest accuracy? 
3) What recommendations could we make for customers with specific housing criteria requirement? 

This project has set out to explain the variability of rental prices within Seattle, Washington, 
and by what criteria are these rental prices most affected, and then to create a predictive model 
that best predicts rental pricing. 

Our hypothesis suggests that price variability is most correlated 
with the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as the total square footage of the apartment.
